chatbot
=======

Automated response Chatbot, implemented with python. Connects to jabber chat protocol server.
Object is for your program to carry on a human-like dialog with a user, using plain English.

Testing framework: I embed my code in a client program for the jabber chat protocol (similar to MSN chat or AIM chat)

The final objective is to produce what is known as a chatroom "bot" -- a "robotic" occupant of a chatroom.
